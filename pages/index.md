# Hypercerts Documentation

Hypercerts are structured digital records of contributions — who did what, when, where, and with what supporting documentation. Build applications that create, evaluate, and fund impactful work.

## Get started

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)** | Create your first hypercert in under 5 minutes |
| **[Creating Your First Hypercert](/getting-started/creating-your-first-hypercert)** | Step-by-step guide to creating a complete hypercert with contributions and attachments |
| **[Working with Evaluations](/getting-started/working-with-evaluations)** | Evaluate hypercerts and build trust in the ecosystem |
| **[Common Use Cases](/getting-started/common-use-cases)** | How hypercerts work for different types of contributions |
| **[Building on Hypercerts](/getting-started/building-on-hypercerts)** | Integration patterns for platforms and tools that want to build on the protocol |
| **[Testing & Deployment](/getting-started/testing-and-deployment)** | Test your integration, understand record constraints, and go live |

## Core concepts

| | |
|---|---|
| **[What are Hypercerts?](/core-concepts/what-is-hypercerts)** | Living digital records of impact that help you track, share, and get recognized for the work you do |
| **[Core Data Model](/core-concepts/hypercerts-core-data-model)** | Record types, dimensions, and how they connect |
| **[Certified Identity](/core-concepts/certified-identity)** | How identity works in the Hypercerts ecosystem — DIDs, signing, portability, and wallet linkage |
| **[Why AT Protocol?](/core-concepts/why-at-protocol)** | Why the Hypercerts Protocol is built on AT Protocol |
| **[Funding & Value Flow](/core-concepts/funding-and-value-flow)** | How hypercerts track funding of activities and optionally wrap claims in onchain tokens |

## Tools

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Hypercerts SDK](/tools/sdk)** | TypeScript SDK for ATProto authentication, repository operations, and React integration |
| **[Scaffold Starter App](/tools/scaffold)** | A Next.js starter app for building on ATProto with the Hypercerts SDK |
| **[Hypercerts CLI](/tools/hypercerts-cli)** | A Go command-line tool for managing hypercerts on ATProto |
| **[Hyperindex](/tools/hyperindex)** | ATProto indexer that indexes hypercert records and exposes them via GraphQL |
| **[Hyperboard](/tools/hyperboard)** | A visual board that showcases the contributors to a hypercert |

## Architecture

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview)** | How the Hypercerts Protocol stack fits together |
| **[Account & Identity Setup](/architecture/account-and-identity)** | Understand your identity, configure custom domains, and manage credentials |
| **[Data Flow & Lifecycle](/architecture/data-flow-and-lifecycle)** | How a hypercert moves from creation through evaluation to funding |
| **[Indexers & Discovery](/architecture/indexers-and-discovery)** | How indexers make hypercerts findable across the network |
| **[Portability & Scaling](/architecture/portability-and-scaling)** | Migration, performance, and privacy |
