# General Lexicons

## Introduction

These general lexicons provide common data structures and definitions that can be shared across multiple protocols and applications, including the hypercert claim lexicons. Think of them as the building blocks or primitive types that other, more specialized lexicons can reference and build upon.

By centralizing these common patterns in certified lexicons, we avoid duplication across the ecosystem and ensure consistency. When a hypercerts-specific lexicon needs to reference a URI or location, it can simply reference the certified definitions rather than recreating them.
