# What are Hypercerts?

A hypercert is a living digital record of impact. It allows you to track the work you've done — and how others can see, evaluate, and support it.

Think of it like this: you do meaningful work — restoring a forest, maintaining open-source software, running a community program, publishing research. A hypercert captures that work in a structured way that anyone can verify. Over time, other people can add to it: attaching evidence, measurements, and evaluations that make the record richer and more trustworthy.

## What goes into a hypercert

At its core, a hypercert answers four questions:

- **Who** did the work?
- **What** did they do?
- **When** did it happen?
- **Where** did it take place?

That's the starting point. From there, the record grows as people add more context:

- **Evidence** — photos, links, documents, or descriptions that show the work happened
- **Measurements** — numbers that make the impact concrete ("142 issues resolved", "50 hectares restored")
- **Evaluations** — independent assessments from people with domain expertise
- **Contributions** — who specifically was involved and what they did
- **Rights** — what rights come with the hypercert (display, transfer, etc.)

A hypercert isn't a static document you file and forget. It's a living record that accumulates evidence and trust over time.

## How people use them

**If you're doing the work**, you create a hypercert to make your contributions visible. Instead of writing reports that sit in a folder, you have a verifiable record that any platform in the ecosystem can display.

**If you're evaluating work**, you add your assessment to someone else's hypercert. Your evaluation lives on your own data server — it's your reputation on the line, attached to their work.

**If you're funding work**, you can see the full picture before making a decision: the original claim, the evidence behind it, and what independent evaluators think. No more guessing.

**If you're building a platform**, you can read and write hypercerts using shared schemas. A funding platform, a project dashboard, and an evaluation tool can all work with the same data.

## An example

Say a team restores mangrove forests in the Sundarbans. They create a hypercert:

> **Mangrove restoration in Sundarbans, 2025**
>
> 50 hectares restored over 12 months. Satellite imagery confirms canopy coverage. An independent ecologist evaluates the work as "high-quality restoration with strong community engagement."

That record lives on the team's own data server. It's not locked into any single platform. Any app in the ecosystem can display it. Any evaluator can add their take. Any funder can look at the full picture and decide whether to support the next phase.

Hypercerts aren't just for environmental work. People use them for open-source software, scientific research, journalism, community organizing, digital public goods — any work where impact matters but is hard to make visible.

## Why it's built this way

Hypercerts are built on [AT Protocol](/getting-started/why-atproto), the same decentralized data layer that powers Bluesky. This means:

- **You own your data.** Your hypercerts live on your Personal Data Server, not on someone else's platform.
- **It's portable.** You can move your data to a different server anytime. No lock-in.
- **It's verifiable.** Every record is cryptographically signed. Anyone can check that it hasn't been tampered with.
- **It works everywhere.** Any app that speaks the Hypercerts protocol can read and display your records.
