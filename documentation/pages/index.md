#### What are Hypercerts?

Hypercerts make real value creation legible and fundable.

The current economic system struggles to recognize, track, and reward the people and projects that create collective value — from digital public goods and open-source ecosystems to regenerative land management and community initiatives. Hypercerts are an open, interoperable protocol for making contributions legible, fundable, and coordinated across platforms — turning abstract value creation into structured, shareable, and interoperable data.

At their core, hypercerts are digital records that describe who did what, when, where, and with what evidence — without prescribing a single metric or funding mechanism. By making work visible and traceable, hypercerts enable value recognition networks where contributors, evaluators, and funders can interact constructively. Hypercerts are designed not as a single application or marketplace, but as a shared language and infrastructure that supports experimentation in funding, evaluation, and impact coordination across domains.
