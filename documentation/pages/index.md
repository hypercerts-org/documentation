# Hypercerts Documentation

Hypercerts are structured digital records of contributions — who did what, when, where, and with what supporting documentation. Build applications that create, evaluate, and fund impactful work.

## Get started

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)** | Install the SDK and create your first hypercert in under 5 minutes |
| **[Creating Your First Hypercert](/tutorials/creating-your-first-hypercert)** | Build a complete hypercert with contributions, attachments, and measurements |
| **[Working with Evaluations](/tutorials/working-with-evaluations)** | Create evaluations of other people's work |
| **[Common Use Cases](/tutorials/common-use-cases)** | Worked examples for open-source, climate, research, and community projects |
| **[Building on Hypercerts](/reference/building-on-hypercerts)** | Integration patterns for funding platforms, dashboards, and evaluation tools |
| **[Testing & Deployment](/reference/testing-and-deployment)** | Test locally, understand constraints, and go live |

## Core concepts

| | |
|---|---|
| **[What are Hypercerts?](/getting-started/what-is-hypercerts)** | The record structure, how people use them, and why they're built on ATProto |
| **[Core Data Model](/getting-started/hypercerts-core-data-model)** | Record types, dimensions, and how they connect |
| **[Certified Identity](/ecosystem/what-is-certified)** | How identity works — DIDs, signing, portability, and wallet linkage |
| **[Why ATProto?](/getting-started/why-atproto)** | Why the protocol is built on AT Protocol |
| **[Funding & Value Flow](/architecture/funding-and-tokenization)** | How hypercerts track funding and optionally wrap claims in onchain tokens |

## Tools

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Scaffold Starter App](/tools/scaffold)** | Next.js reference app with OAuth, creation wizard, and browsing |
| **[Hypercerts CLI](/tools/hypercerts-cli)** | Create and manage hypercerts from the command line |
| **[Hyperindex](/tools/hyperindex)** | GraphQL API for querying hypercert records across the network |
| **[Hyperboard](/tools/hyperboard)** | Visual contributor boards for attribution and funding transparency |

## Architecture

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview)** | How the protocol stack fits together |
| **[Account & Identity Setup](/getting-started/account-and-identity)** | DIDs, handles, custom domains, and organization accounts |
| **[Data Flow & Lifecycle](/architecture/data-flow-and-lifecycle)** | How a hypercert moves from creation through evaluation to funding |
| **[Indexers & Discovery](/architecture/indexers-and-discovery)** | How indexers make hypercerts findable across the network |
| **[Portability & Scaling](/architecture/portability-and-scaling)** | Migration, performance, and privacy |
