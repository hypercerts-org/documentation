# What is Certified?

[Certified](https://certified.app) is the identity provider for the Hypercerts ecosystem. Create one account and you can sign in to every application built on the Hypercerts Protocol — and your hypercerts, evaluations, and other records travel with you across all of them. Think of it as your passport to the world of impact certificates.

## Why Certified exists

Certified is a neutral identity provider that isn't tied to any single application — it gives Hypercerts users an entry point that doesn't require knowledge of Bluesky, ATProto, or decentralized protocols. For the full background on why a dedicated identity provider exists alongside Bluesky, see [Account & Identity Setup](/getting-started/account-and-identity#why-certified).

## What you get

- **Low-friction sign-in** — No usernames, handles, or passwords to remember. Sign in with just your email and a code.
- **Ecosystem access** — Your Certified identity is recognized by every application built on the Hypercerts Protocol.
- **Web3 wallet** — Add your existing wallet to your Certified identity, or get a new embedded wallet.
- **A DID (Decentralized Identifier)** — Your permanent, portable identity. It stays the same even if you change servers or handles.
- **A Personal Data Server (PDS)** — Your hypercerts, evaluations, and other records are stored here. You own this data.
- **Data portability** — You can migrate your data to another PDS at any time. No lock-in.

## Already have a Bluesky account or another AT Protocol account?

{% callout type="note" %}
If you already have a Bluesky account or another AT Protocol account, you don't need a Certified account. Any AT Protocol identity works with all Hypercerts applications. Log in with your existing handle (e.g., `alice.bsky.social`) — everything just works.
