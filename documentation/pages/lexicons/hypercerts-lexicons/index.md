# Hypercerts Lexicons

These lexicons define the record types for tracking impact work in the `org.hypercerts` namespace. The **activity claim** is the central record — all other types attach to it.

| Lexicon | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[Activity Claim](/lexicons/hypercerts-lexicons/activity-claim)** | The core hypercert record — who did what, when, where |
| **[Contribution](/lexicons/hypercerts-lexicons/contribution)** | Contributor identity and contribution details (two lexicons) |
| **[Attachment](/lexicons/hypercerts-lexicons/attachment)** | Supporting documentation — URLs, files, IPFS links |
| **[Measurement](/lexicons/hypercerts-lexicons/measurement)** | Quantitative data attached to a claim |
| **[Evaluation](/lexicons/hypercerts-lexicons/evaluation)** | Third-party assessment of a claim |
| **[Collection](/lexicons/hypercerts-lexicons/collection)** | Groups activity claims and/or other collections into a project |
| **[Rights](/lexicons/hypercerts-lexicons/rights)** | Rights associated with a hypercert |
