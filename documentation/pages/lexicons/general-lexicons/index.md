# General Lexicons

These general lexicons provide common data structures and definitions shared across multiple protocols and applications. They live in the `app.certified` namespace — building blocks that other, more specialized lexicons can reference.

| Lexicon | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[Shared Definitions](/lexicons/general-lexicons/shared-defs)** | Reusable types: URIs, blob sizes, image constraints |
| **[Location](/lexicons/general-lexicons/location)** | Geographic location representation using the Astral Location Protocol |
