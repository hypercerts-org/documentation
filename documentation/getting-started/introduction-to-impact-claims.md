# Introduction to Impact Claims

### Introduction to Claims

Everything in the Hypercerts ecosystem consists of claims records.&#x20;

The primary "activity" claim—commonly referred to as the hypercert—serves as the central record that tracks impact work. On the diagram below, it's referred to as the green box.&#x20;

Additional claims can then be attached to this core activity, including measurement claims, evidence claims, contribution claims, evaluation claims, and other supporting claims that substantiate or provide context for the claimed impact.

### Standalone

Claims are standalone. They do not necessarily have to be linked to each other. You can create a measurement claim first, and then later attach it to a specific activity claim, if required.&#x20;

Hypercerts can exist as a standalone activity claim, or it can be tokenized to then be listed up for sale in a marketplace.&#x20;
